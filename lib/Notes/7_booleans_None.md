# Introduction to Python Development 


## CHAPTER 2.4
## Booleans and None


1. Learn about how Python represents truthiness and nothingness.

2. Python Documentation For [Booleans & None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing)

## Booleans
1. Booleans represent ***"truthiness"*** and Python has two boolean constants: ***True and False.***

2. Notice that these both start with capital letters. Later we will learn about comparisons operations, and those will often return either True or False.

## Representing Nothingness with None
1. Most programming languages have a type that represents the lack of a value, and Python is no different.
1. The constant used to represent nothingness in Python is ***None.*** None is a "falsy", and we'll often use it to represent ***when a variable has no value yet.***

1. An interesting thing to note about None is that if you type None into your REPL there will be nothing printed to the screen. That's because None actually ***evaluates into nothing.***
